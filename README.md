Desc
It is a flower with spinning petals. I went for a minimalistic net.art style, after many painful retries with this mini_ex, which clearly explains to the user, what they're seeing. The most significant part of it, is its illusion of the petals spinning backwards as well as forward. This comes from use of the vagon effect. : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon-wheel_effect.
My piece is sadly not interactive after multiple tries of working with p5.dom. 


On the notion of Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming is a way to structure a programming language, as such that it is able to make what is refered to  as objects. This is a piece of code with properties, values and functions within them. This can also be made through a constructor function, which functions like a machine making makes objects. This makes for programs that are efficient at handling and making pieces of codes that are associated with many attributes, as giving such to a variable, or an array filled with them, in other languages can be tidious. The disadvantage is the huge amount of planning that goes into the program, as well as the time consuming process of making these programs.


On the notion of HTML5 objects in p5.dom

Up until this mini_ex(n) I have had little to no trouble making objects as well as constructors. Working with p5.dom created a lot of trouble though. The constructor function would not make buttons and the dom elements was in general troublesome to work with. I would have coloured my flower, but doing the .style() function more than once resultet in my program bugging. I have sadly not have had the wanted time to spend on this project, as moving demanded more much time than expected.
